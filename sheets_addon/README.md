# What is this?
This is a plugin for Google Sheets that I wrote. The script has the following features:
- Pull third-party data from various sources and parse JSON responses into a standard format in a proprietary Google Sheet template.
- Take data from the spreadsheet and place it into pre-defined Google Doc templates (useful for contract generation & payment schedules, etc.)
- Provide a user-friendly interface (in the form of a side bar) as well as a useful error dialog.
