    <b>Something feel broken? This can occur due to AirDNA not having sufficient data on the address you've specified.</b>
    <br><br>
    A few scenarios can cause this:
    <ul>
        <li><b>AirDNA doesn't have enough data on that address's region.</b></li>
            <ul>
                 <li>Search on <a href='https://www.airdna.co/'>AirDNA</a> to find nearby neighborhoods/regions/cities with enough data. </li>
                 <li>For example, 'Els Hostalets de Pierola, Barcelona' has no data, but nearby 'Esparreguera' does. </li>
            </ul>
        <li><b>The property you are appraising has more bedrooms than other properties in the surrounding area.</b></li>
             <ul>
                 <li>If the property has more than 5 bedrooms, try lowering the number of bedrooms one-at-a-time and rerunning the appraisal.</li>
            </ul>
        <li><b>We might be having difficulty getting the city or region ID from our 3rd party sources.</b></li>
             <ul>
                 <li>We use this ID to get percentile data. If none of the above tips works, reach out to spencer@ or ashby@ for help.</li>
            </ul>    
    </ul>
